Observations:
- Logic on the LocalBytes is not correct. The device does NOT default to off.
- The logic on Hub5 is reversed, opposite to Hub3.

Tests:
  - Pairing of ESP01 and Hub3 was successful.
    - Testing a 220v Earthed Cable was successful when Hub was on Computer USB.
    - Testing a 220v Earthed Cable was unsuccessful when Hub was on main power + isolator. The unit would not sense the voltage unlesss wrapped in a certain angle.**
  - Pairing of Hub5 and LocalBytes is evident. LocalBytes, however, needs manual intervention everytime to get it paired.
    - Testing a 220v Earthed Cable was successful when on Computer USB, BUT, the logic is opposite (Off when power is ON and vice versa).
    - Testing a 220v Earthed Cable was unsuccessful when Hub was on main power + isolator. The unit would switch between on and off regardless of cable status.
